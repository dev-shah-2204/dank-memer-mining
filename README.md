# DANK-MEMER CURRENCY MINER SELF-BOT

The code isn't very complex, it's rather simple. The bot sends 3 commands every 44 seconds; `pls beg`, `pls fish` and `pls dig`. After doing this 10 times, the bot sends a random normal message or another dank-memer command, and then takes a 2 minute 'break'.

The reason for all this fuss? Well, dank-memer is a smart bot. Or I should say it's developers are quite smart and probably thought this through. There are other people like me who are "mining" or "farming" dank-memer's currency, which obviously isn't very ethical. I shouldn't even be posting this on GitHub, I think, but since I'm doing it, let me explain.

Dank Memer WILL blacklist you from using any command if "he" gets to know you're mining/farming. If you make an ultra-efficient farming bot that sends the commands as soon as the command-cooldown is over 24/7 then Dank Memer WILL know that it's not a person typing the commands, it's a bot.

## EARNINGS/STATISTICS:
Most selling prices have the multiplier boost added, so I'm not sure about the actual prices

Total Multi: 37% (max of 500%)
-Level up rewards (+4%) </br>
-#dank-memer (+5%) </br>
-Sharing LORD (+10%) </br>
-Upvoted (+5%) </br>
-Vote Reminder On (+5%) </br>
-Tips Enabled (+8%) </br>

I let the miner run for 24 hours, and this is what I got(2): </br>
`324,919` coins from begging

-19  `Alcohol` = 22,800 </br>
-27  `Bank Notes` = 270,000 (More if you trade them) </br>
-41  `Blue Phallic Object` N/A (Trade price according to Dank-Memer is 50k-100k) </br>
-71  `Fresh Bread` = 52,185 </br>
-13  `Candy` N/A (Don't sell them, use them) </br>
-59  `Cookie` = 43,365 </br>
-25  `Exotic Fish` = 183,750 (More if you trade them) </br>
-266 `Common Fish` = 391,020 </br>
-63  `Fishing Pole` = 157,500 </br>
-211 `Garbage` = 62,034 </br>
-2   `Golden Phallic Object` = N/A (Trade price according to Dank-Memer is 500k-1M) </br>
-5   `Lucky Horseshoe` =  N/A (Don't sell them, use them) </br>
-17  `Jelly Fish` = 199,920 </br>
-25  `Laptop` = 8,750 </br>
-18  `Padlock` = 6,300 </br>
-2   `Pizza Slice` = 50,000 </br>
-64  `Rare Fish` = 282,240 </br>
-56  `Box of Sand` = 28,000 </br>
-205 `Seaweed` = 150,675 </br>

For items that were supposed to be traded, I used the lower-limit of the range. That brings us to a total of `5,283,458` coins after selling and trading all the inventory items.

## HOW TO USE:
In case you didn't figure out how to set this up, refer `example.py`. </br>
If you have no idea how python works, just go to https://atom.io and download it. Atom is a text editor, but for code. After doing that, follow these steps: </br>

1) Open the folder containing the files in atom.
2) Press `ctrl + ,` on your keyboard
3) Go to the `Install` tab and search for `atom-python-run` and install it
4) Open CMD or PowerShell and type `pip install discord`
5) After that, open the `example.py` file, enter your token and channel ID, and then press  `F5`
6) When running `control_miner.py` file, you'll need to change the channel ID and your token in there again (line 20 and line 30 respectively)

If you don't know how to get the channel ID or your token, look it up on YouTube, I can't type it all here.

## HOW TO TRANSFER MONEY:

1) Open `control_miner.py` and enter your credentials
2) Run file
3) After the command window says `ready`, start typing your messages like `pls give @user all` or `pls give 4 rarepepe @user`

(1) : Don't quote me on this, I'm not sure about it, but rather safe than sorry, precaution is better than cure and everything.
(2) : These stats are quite old and Dank Memer has been updated quite a few times after that. These stats might not be accurate
