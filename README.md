# DANK-MEMER CURRENCY MINER SELF-BOT

The code isn't very complex, it's rather simple. The bot sends 2 commands every minute; `pls beg` and `pls fish`. After doing this 10 times, the bot sends a random normal message or another dank-memer command, and then takes a 5 minute 'break'.

The reason for all this fuss? Well, dank-memer is a smart bot. Or I should say it's developer is quite smart and probably thought this through. There are other people like me who are "mining" or "farming" dank-memer's currency, which obviously isn't very ethical. I shouldn't even be posting this on GitHub, I think, but since I'm doing it, let me explain.

Dank Memer WILL blacklist you from using any command if "he" gets to know you're mining/farming. If you make an ultra-efficient farming bot that sends the commands as soon as the command-cooldown is over 24/7 the bot WILL know that it's not a person typing the commands, it's a bot.

## EARNINGS/STATISTICS:
Note: You won't get the same amount, it depends on luck
Most selling prices have the multiplier boost added, so I'm not sure about the actual prices

Total Multi: 37% (max of 500%) </br>

-#dank-memer (+5%) </br>
-Sharing LORD (+10%) </br>

-Tips Enabled (+8%) </br>

I let the miner run for 24 hours, and this is what I got: </br>
`324,919` coins from begging

-19  `Alcohol` = 22,800 </br>
-27  `Bank Notes` = 270,000 (More if you trade them) </br>
-41  `Blue Phallic Object` N/A (Trade price according to Dank-Memer is 50k-100k) </br>
-71  `Fresh Bread` = 52,185 </br>
-13  `Candy` N/A (Don't sell them, use them) </br>
-59  `Cookie` = 43,365 </br>
-25  `Exotic Fish` = 183,750 (More if you trade them) </br>
-266 `Common Fish` = 391,020 </br>
-63  `Fishing Pole` = 157,500 </br>
-211 `Garbage` = 62,034 </br>
-2   `Golden Phallic Object` = N/A (Trade price according to Dank-Memer is 500k-1M) </br>
-5   `Lucky Horseshoe` =  N/A (Don't sell them, use them) </br>
-17  `Jelly Fish` = 199,920 </br>
-25  `Laptop` = 8,750 </br>
-18  `Padlock` = 6,300 </br>
-2   `Pizza Slice` = 50,000 </br>
-64  `Rare Fish` = 282,240 </br>
-56  `Box of Sand` = 28,000 </br>
-205 `Seaweed` = 150,675 </br>

For items that were supposed to be traded, I used the lower-limit of the range. That brings us to a total of `5,283,458` coins after selling and trading all the inventory items.

P.S. these are the stats of 1 miner, I had 4 running.

## HOW TO USE:
In case you didn't figure out how to set this up, refer `example.py`. </br>
If you have no idea how python works, just go to https://atom.io and download it. Atom is a text </br> editor, but for code. After doing that, follow these steps: </br>

1) Open the folder containing the files in atom.
2) Press `ctrl + ,` on your keyboard
3) Go to the `Install` tab and search for `atom-python-run` and install it
4) After that, open the `example.py` file, enter your token and channel ID, and then press  `F5`

If you don't know how to get the channel ID or your token, look it up on YouTube, I can't type it all here.

## HOW TO TRANSFER MONEY:

1) Open `control_miner.py` and enter your credentials
2) Run file
3) After the command window says `ready`, start typing your messages


## WARNING:
Your account *might* get blacklisted temporarily or permanently(1). I advise you to make another account that you don't plan on using for chatting, joining other servers etc..


(1) : Don't quote me on this, I'm not sure about it, but rather safe than sorry, precaution is better than cure and everything.
