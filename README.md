# DANK-MEMER CURRENCY MINER SELF-BOT

The code isn't very complex, it's rather simple. The bot sends 2 commands every minute; `pls beg` and `pls fish`. After doing this 10 times, the bot sends a random normal message or another dank-memer command, and then takes a 5 minute 'break'.

The reason for all this fuss? Well, dank-memer is a quite smart bot. Or I should say it's developer is quite smart and probably thought this through. There are other people like me who are "mining" or "farming" dank-memer's currency, which obviously isn't very ethical. I shouldn't even be posting this on GitHub, I think, but since I'm doing it, let me explain.

Dank Memer WILL blacklist you from using any command if "he" gets to know you're mining/farming. If you make an ultra-efficient farming bot that sends the commands as soon as the command-cooldown is over 24/7 the bot WILL know that it's not a person typing the commands, it's a bot.

## HOW TO USE:
In case you didn't figure out how to set this up, refer `example.py`.
If you have no idea how python works, just go to https://atom.io and download it. Atom is a text editor, but for code. After doing that, follow these steps:

1) Open the folder containing the files in atom.
2) Press `ctrl + ,` on your keyboard
3) Go to the `Install` tab and search for `atom-python-run` and install it
4) After that, open the `example.py` file, enter your token and channel ID, and then press  `F5`

If you don't know how to get the channel ID or your token, look it up on YouTube, I can't type it all here.

## WARNING:
Your account *might* get blacklisted temporarily or permanently(1). I advise you to make another account that you don't plan on using for chatting, joining other servers etc..


(1) : Don't quote me on this, I'm not sure about it, but rather safe than sorry, precaution is better than cure and everything.

## EARNINGS (I'll post accurate one later):
Depending on your luck, you can make approximately 70,000-90,000 coins from begging alone (Let it run for the whole day, 24 hours), and 200,000-500,000 or more from fishing, again, depending on your luck.
